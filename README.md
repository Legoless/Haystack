Haystack contains multiple extensions and enhancements for **iOS** development, including a collection of simple Objective-C classes and categories that fit in almost every project. Most of these classes are not large or structured enough to fit in a special library or framework, but are regurarely needed throughout the most projects you are working on. Basically it is meant to fill the void of classes without entire libraries.

Project is actively developed and as the Apple SDK's changes, the project is updated too. Note that the project is not finished and might contain bugs. Feel free to open an issue. To avoid clashing with any future framework methods or classes, all Haystack classes are prefixed with `HAY` and category methods are also prefixed with lowercase `hay_`, to separate them from rest of the frameworks.

### Swift Support

*[Saystack](https://github.com/legoless/saystack) is the Swift version of Haystack.*

*Haystack supports Swift, but as it is written in Objective-C the API was built for Objective-C applications. Carthage support on the way. If you are only supporting iOS 8.x and greater, you can already use Haystack as a framework.*


Contents
========
Haystack is also contains other resources used in development, such as scripts. Resources are divided into sections, each of which is represented by a folder of the same name:

- **Pods**

   Example podfiles that are used in many of the commercial projects, including more advanced configurations and even podspec files to create new specifications.  
   
   
- **Scripts**

   Handful of Bash and Ruby scripts that speed up iOS development. Scripts include management of Xcode SDK's, copying them around, which is useful for Beta development.

- **SDK**

   Contains Objective-C classes and categories that are installed part of a CocoaPods install. The classes are general and extend base Apple SDK's. **Haystack SDK supports iOS 7 and up**.

Usage
=======

Documentation
-------
All header files and fully documented for ease of use. Only method stubs are displayed in readme, to keep it short. The documentation is in **DoxyGen** format, allowing Xcode to parse documentation headers or generate HTML docs.

Installation & Setup
--------
You can install the SDK via CocoaPods:
```
pod 'Haystack'
```

Or manually drag & drop `Haystack` folder into Xcode project, then follow the **Using in project** section.

Using in project
--------
It is recommended for you to add Haystack.h file into precompiled header (.pch). That way all classes and categories are added to all files and you can use them everywhere throughout the project.

Documents
=======
Haystack SDK includes documents that can be used to improve development workflow.

- **Deployment workflow**
  - Automated testing
  - Continuous Integration
- **Coding guidelines**
- **Development tools**
